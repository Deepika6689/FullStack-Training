<h3 align="center">Software Development Intern – Pentagon Space</h3>

Currently working as a **Software Development Intern** at Pentagon Space, gaining hands-on experience in:

- Real-world development tasks  
- Writing clean and structured code  
- Understanding industry workflows  
- Collaborative team environment  
- Improving problem-solving skills  

This internship is helping me bridge academic learning with real-world software development.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 📁 HTML Practice Projects

• **resume.html** – Simple resume webpage using basic HTML structure  
• **employee-table.html** – Employee details displayed using HTML tables  
• **lists_practice.html** – Practice file for ordered, unordered, and nested lists  
• **foodmenu.html** – Restaurant food menu designed using HTML  

These files help me practice core HTML concepts like:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Lists
- Tables
- Page structure

## 📌 About This Repository

**FullStack-Training** is my personal development repository where I document everything I learn during my internship journey in web development and programming.

This repo contains practice files, code experiments, notes, and mini-projects as I work my way through HTML, Python, and future full-stack topics.
